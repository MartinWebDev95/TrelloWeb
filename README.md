# Frontend Practice Challenge (Trello Web)

Frontend Practice is a collection of real and carefully chosen websites for developers to recreate as a way to improve and test their skills. We believe that a building from scratch approach will teach you a multitude of skills, including design, interactions, animations, troubleshooting, responsiveness, and more.

In this case, I made this challenge with React JS and Styled Components.

This is Trello's original page: https://trello.com/

And this is the one I made: https://trello-web-martinwebdev95.vercel.app/
